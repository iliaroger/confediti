## goals of this crate

The main goals of this crate are the following:

- update and install your local config files with a cli tool on any machine (mac, linux)
- nvim and tmux files should be the main goal in the first update (upload, install, update)
- command based installation of any services, programs and directories such as node, nvim, brew etc. from a list
  saving you countless of minutes doing that yourself

## concept

Recovery mode: You already have downloaded and initialised the complete setup on a different machine and you find yourself
